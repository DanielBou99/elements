  <h1>Use cases</h1>

  <p>
    Let's explore some of the use cases which can be solved using this
    library...
  </p>

  <h2 id="sub-applications">Microfrontends style "sub-applications"</h2>

  <p>
    Imagine a large enterprise organization building many standalone frontend
    applications which look exactly the same but handle only single aspect of
    business requirements. A user will seamlessly switch between apps using
    standard HTML hyperlinks without noticing anything special. From users
    perspective it behaves as a single application with lots of features.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's say many of these application will share some piece of functionality,
    for example a "case widget" which will let employees know what they should
    be working on.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    This kind of widget will be pretty isolated in terms of its model (data) and
    its sharing with the rest of application. Application will most likely just
    pass in some context and react to widget events...

  <p>
    In real life scenario, many of these applications will be developed by
    independent teams and have independent release cycles. This means that if we
    implement our widget as standard Angular library and released a new version
    (for example 3.1.0) we would have to wait for new releases (and deployments)
    of every consumer application before we could be sure that the our widget
    lib made it fully to the production...

    Or we can face situation when we are running different versions of the same
    widget in various apps which may cause other problems related to breaking
    changes, incompatible data models which may introduce additional complexity
    for backends...
  </p>

  <blockquote class="large">
    Wouldn't it be great if we could deploy new version of our widget
    independently from release cycle of consumer applications?
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This is exactly what is enabled by this library! The "sub-application"
    element is released and deployed independently as a single file bundle which
    is then <strong>referenced ONLY by the url</strong> in the consumer apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    To make referencing easier, the bundle file name can always stay the same
    (for example <code>some-element.js</code> without any hash) for every
    version of the element. The cache busting is then handled with the help of
    <code>etag</code> which is transparently calculated based on the file
    content on the server. Learn more about
    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag"
      target="_blank"
      >ETag</a
    >
    HTTP response headers.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    We could still employ query params (or even file name versioning) in case we
    would like to have more granular control about which version of the element
    will be downloaded by the consumer app to facilitate stuff like A/B testing.
    Please note that this has to be implemented with corresponding support on
    the server side.

    Let's say we want to build fully dynamic application. An application which
    will be built from the individual blocks <strong>at runtime</strong> based
    on some configuration. The configuration itself can be provided from the
    start but can also be retrieved later, for example asynchronously (and
    possibly multiple times) from a backend...
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    The standard example of such an application is configurable dashboard where
    users can create fully custom layouts based on what kind of information they
    need using all the available widgets.

    While it is possible to implement this using
    <strong>standard Angular approach</strong>, the resulting solution will most
    likely be very complex and have <strong>severe limitations</strong> in terms
    of used technologies and whole release / deployment lifecycle management.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, using <code>*axLazyElementDynamic</code> directive
    enables us to lazy load any web component to be used inside of out Angular
    application <strong>without hard-coding of its tag name</strong>
    inside of the consumer Angular component template.
  </p>

    Using <code>*axLazyElementDynamic</code> enables us to specify custom
    element tag dynamically during runtime while still leveraging standard
    Angular template property and event bindings!

    Let's say we are building an Angular application and we are paying extra
    attention to architecture of the features making them nicely isolated and
    lazy loaded. The performance, maintainability and start up time of our
    application is great!
  </p>

  <p>
    Then comes in a new requirement to add possibility to inline edit every item
    of a large list using a powerful (but also very heavy) rich text editor. As
    a result the size and hence loading of that feature will suffer even though
    the editor is only displayed as a result of user interaction and never from
    the start.

  <blockquote class="large">
    Ability to seamlessly load element once it was rendered as a result of user
    interaction is exactly what can be achieved using
    <code>*axLazyElement</code> directive!
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    Another possible solution to this problem could be by implementing custom
    component loader service using plain Angular. Unfortunately, currently (as
    of version <code>8.1.0</code>) such an approach is only possible using
    deprecated APIs and is pretty complex in itself...
